# 1) Name a few built in data type in python -> str, boolean, int, float, list, dictionary, tuple, set.
# 2) What are atomic types , give example -> atomic data types are those which can store only 1 value in them, they are the smallest unit of storing variable.
# 3) What are container types -> Those which can store multiple values inside a single variable name. 3 types in container data type 1) Associative 2) Sequencial 3) Neither Associative nor sequential.
# 4) Difference between seq, associative -> Seq are those which have indexing ability eg, list, str, tuple , Associative are those which can be associated with other number, or string, or list, eg key value pair, dictionary
# 5) Difference between mutable and immutable -> Mutable types are those which can be changed once created, or assigned a memory location, immutable are those which cannot be changed once they are created or assigned memory address.
# 6) Name mutable types -> List, dictionary, set.
# 7) Name immutable types -> Boolean, tuple, str, float, int.
# 8) Which data types can be indexed in python -> list, string. dictionary, tuple
